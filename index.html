<h1>Chromatic Polynomials of Signed Graphs</h1>
<h3> Welcome! </h3>
<p>This webpage provides the visualisation of chromatic roots of signed graphs deduced from the chromatic polynomials
(the default and its zero-free counterparts) which will be explained under the project, "Chromatic Polynomials of Signed Graphs".</p>
